This is the old location of the `silabs-pti.jar` and you should no longer use this version here.

`silabs-pti.jar` has moved into [its own github repo](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/java_packet_trace_library) and is available from there.

If you want to dowload the latest jar, follow to [actions tab on that repo](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/java_packet_trace_library/actions) click on the latest succesful build there and download the artifacts.

The [old version that is here](silabs-pti-capture-old.jar) is provided solely for backwards compatibility reasons, if someone trully desires this old version, but for all other purposes you should move to the new location.
